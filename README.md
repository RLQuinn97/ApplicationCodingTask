Coding Task for Coding Task for Job Application

- API functionality is in SympliTaskBackend.Controllers
- Unit Tests are in SympliTaskUnitTests.SEOSearchTests.cs

## Working Functionality
- Search Google top 100 results with basic caching and result response formatting
- Functionality to map other search engines with basic HTML results

## Not Yet Working
- Bing search: Didn't have a way to execute the JavaScript functionality on this page. In a similar real life scenario I used Selenium/PhantomJS to execute the DOM for this. Without making use of 3rd Party packages I didn't figure out a neat way to do it.
- Yahoo search: After trying this with an incorrect search URL once, I now get 500 errors when accessing any Yahoo pages from my computer. I will test this out more if and when they ever unban me...
- No React Front end: I didn't consider myself strong enough with React to develop a front end for this in a timely manner. Most of my work with React up until now has been very simple modifications of existing functionality - clearly any area I need to work on! :)
